# ChatBot

Chatbot for Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering 

- An ML model that can respond to the user's queries.

#Problem Statement 

This project should focus on creating a chatbot integrated into the college website to be used by stakeholders to get their queries responded easily from the college website.

The College Enquiry Chatbot has the capacity to make friendly conversations; respond to the course and faculty details; provide links to various features available on the college website; answer the frequently asked questions; give the timings, address, contacts, and events information of the departments and student bodies: provide news updates and event notifications and guide students to the right source of information on the website.

The chatbot should have a security feature of validating the human query by sending OTP for verification. The project should scrape data and URLs from the college website to answer user queries.

Also, an admin panel is required to feed answers for the general FAQâ€™s. The chatbot should record the visitor's details and the purpose of the visit if the visitor is new to the website.
